---

I am a DevOps Engineer at Easy Dynamics Corp. My work primarily focuses on migrating government systems to Amazon Web Services. Building automation tools in Python, Java, or Go is a common task. My work covers an array of AWS services including CloudFormation, IAM, Config, Lambda, Systems Manager, and of course EC2 and VPC.

I graduated from James Madison University with a B.S. in Computer Science. My time there included employment in the university's IT department, including the help desk and network engineering team. I was the president of the [Unix Users Group](https://www.jmunixusers.org). My time in the UUG included working on a virtual machine to support the tools used across the CS program at JMU and delivering presentations on an array of Linux- and open source-related topics.

My hobbies include attempting to bake and overengineering my home networks.
